# January 24: Basics of R Programming

Time to get serious about working with data in R. This week we introduce core skills like setting a directory, accessing the functionality of R packages, data input/output, and basic exploration of data. Operations we'll see a lot of: `mutate`, `summarize`, `count`, and the pipe (`%>%`).

## Preparation
- Review [R Survival Guide](https://austin-hart-pols.github.io/SurvivalGuide/), Chs 3 and 4
- Jenny Bryanâ€™s [Stat 545 text](https://stat545.com/), Chs 2 and 5
- Need some intuition about pipes? A [brief intro](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-introduction-to-the-pipe-in-r-823090760d64) for consideration
- Packages you'll need this week:
  - `tidyverse`
  - `knitr`

## Class materials
- My [programming cRash couRse](https://github.com/SIS-data-analysis/02-IntroR/blob/main/cRash-couRse.md)
- Data: [Baltimore Harbor trash wheel data](https://github.com/SIS-data-analysis/02-IntroR/blob/main/trash wheels.csv)

## Assessments
- Problem Set 1 is due in hard copy on January 31. Find it in the [Assessments repository](https://github.com/SIS-data-analysis/Assessments)
- Extra Credit 1: create a [github](https://github.com) account. Email me with your username. 
- Extra Credit 2: take a blind leap into the world of version control by linking RStudio with your github account. Here's what that means and how to do it, again from Jenny Bryan: [Happy Git and GitHub for the UseR](https://happygitwithr.com/install-intro.html). This can be a heavy lift, but I think it will pay off in the long run if you want to nerd out on something in the first weeks.
